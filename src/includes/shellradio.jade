	h2 Shell Community Radio
block content
	p For Intel's IoT Roadshow we've built a community web radio that plays music according to the noise level of the environment. We also planned to implement Spotify and Echo Nest APIs to serve personalised tracks and playlists. On the video, we show how you can connect to the radio through your web browser and listen to the songs.
